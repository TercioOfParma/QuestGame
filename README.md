Might as well start simple for out first project. I made the very very beginning, not much thought process went into this. This should be fun! 

This is written in C++

Update 1: Code was uploaded, I'm in a hurray atm but there is some obvius problems already, the title box is all crooked! Damn it, well anyways. Be sure to leave comments and what not, I can see that the do-while loop could be made into a function so that we can call it, but like I said, I gotta et going soon so I won't have time to make it soon. If you want to make a story line first be sure to comment on the post that's on reddit!
