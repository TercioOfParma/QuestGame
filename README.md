Might as well start simple for out first project. I made the very very beginning, not much thought process went into this. This should be fun! 

This is written in C++

Update 1: Code was uploaded, I'm in a hurray atm but there is some obvius problems already, the title box is all crooked! Damn it, well anyways. Be sure to leave comments and what not, I can see that the do-while loop could be made into a function so that we can call it, but like I said, I gotta et going soon so I won't have time to make it soon. If you want to make a story line first be sure to comment on the post that's on reddit! 


Update 2: Thanks guys, so far it's looking better and better, you guys are so awesome. Now I just gotta understand what exactly is going on. My 2 months of C++ aren't helping much here! Thanks for commenting and explaining stuff. I just gotta do a bit more YouTube and book reading.!
